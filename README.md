## Hello and welcome to the JaxLUG Website collaboration

This repository managed by the vise-president of Jacksonville Linux Users Group (JaxLUG) you can make updates to the website page by the two following methods.  

Method #1
Using GitHub Graphical User Interface (GUI)
  First you need to create a git account and log into it.    
  You can make changes to the JaxLUG page directly thru the GitHub GUI. Select the file you want to
  edit. Select the edit icon on the far right corner. This will branch the file you selected to your
  repository(GitHub account). The file can now be edited or files can be added to the branch in your
  repository. on your account. You will commit the changes in your repository.  It is advisable to check
  the status of the files prior to making a push to the master repository. You will still need to make a
  “Pull-Request”, So the administrators of the webpage will accept the code changes.   
  After the administrator accepts the changes, your code will be “Merge” with the main code in the
  repository.    

Method #2 
Install Git in your machine and use the terminal Git commands. 
   The most common Git commands are:
	- clone = clone the repository to your local workspace.  (document folder)   
	- pull = takes the selected repository and makes a branch in your local machine.
	- commit = saves all changes to your local branch or clone.
	- status =  checks the branch against the master repository.
	- push = uploads your edited files to the master.  (to a staging location) 	
	
   The Git command utilizes version control to manage files in and out of repositories. Git reduces the
   need of manually copying and pasting files from the repository to your local machine. That method
   could create inaccurate file versions, and delete updates made by other users working on the same
   file.
   Git is a way to check the files you have, in your computer, against all the other changes pending
   updates in the master repository made by other contributors.

You will still have to use an HTML editor or Code editor of your liking to edit the code in the files.

When the changes are done and the file is uploaded to GitHub you still need to make a 
“Pull Request” So, a contributor or the manager of the site can approve the changes.
